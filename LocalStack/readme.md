LocalStack

It is a service for playing with AWS services on local pc.
Should have installed Docker, a lot of memory.
The service is far from ideal and just for simple example for junior 
or teaching process for students. This service will not help you 
understand all the dependencies of the AWS it is just for simple 
checking of your code (lambda).
